# Bike Rental Prediction using Weather and Time Data

This project uses the UCI Bike Sharing Dataset (both `day.csv` and `hour.csv`) to predict total bike rentals using weather and time-related features.

## Files Included
- `day.csv` and `hour.csv`: Raw data files.
- `bike_rental_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing full analysis, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and prediction.
- `bike_rental_predictions.csv`: Final prediction output.
- `README.md`: Project explanation and setup instructions.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Evaluation Metric
- RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error), which balances error across small and large counts.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `bike_rental_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to reproduce the preprocessing, training, and prediction pipeline.
